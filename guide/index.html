      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>Why should I care about IVs?</summary>
        <p>
          IVs (Individual Values) are hidden stats that make each Pokemon unique.
          Two Pikachu can have the same CP but different IVs - and in competitive
          battles, those small differences matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          For casual play? Don't stress about IVs. For PvP battles or serious raiding?
          They're worth paying attention to.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What's the difference between PvP and Raids?</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>PvP (Player vs Player)</strong> is battling other trainers - either
          friends or strangers in GO Battle League. You want bulky Pokemon that can
          survive and fight back.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Raids</strong> are cooperative battles against powerful bosses.
          You want Pokemon that hit as hard as possible, even if they're fragile.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same Pokemon might be great for one and bad for the other!
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why do PvP IVs look "bad"?</summary>
        <p>
          In PvP leagues with CP limits (Great League: 1500, Ultra League: 2500),
          you want to maximize your stats within that limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lower Attack IV = lower CP at the same level = you can power up more =
          more total stats. That's why "0/15/15" is often better than "15/15/15"
          for Great League.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's counterintuitive, but the math checks out.

      <details>
        <summary>Should I keep Shadow Pokemon?</summary>
        <p>
          Shadow Pokemon deal 20% more damage but also take 20% more damage.
          This makes them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Great for raids</strong> - more damage = faster wins</li>
          <li><strong>Risky for PvP</strong> - glass cannons that can dominate or crumble</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Don't purify good Shadow Pokemon! The damage bonus is usually worth more
          than the IV boost from purifying.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What does "meta" mean?</summary>
        <p>
          "Meta" is short for "metagame" - it refers to the most effective strategies
          and Pokemon that players are currently using. A "meta Pokemon" is one that's
          commonly used because it's strong and effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meta shifts over time as Niantic releases new Pokemon, moves, and balance changes.
          Our triage tool uses current meta data to help you identify which Pokemon are worth keeping.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to scan every Pokemon?</summary>
        <p>
          For the best results, yes - scan your entire collection. The triage tool
          can find hidden gems you might have overlooked, and it can also identify
          duplicates where you have a better version of the same Pokemon.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, you can also scan just the Pokemon you're unsure about.
          The tool works with any size collection.
