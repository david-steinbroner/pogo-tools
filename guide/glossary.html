      <h2>Basics</h2>

      <dl class="glossary">
        <dt id="iv">IV (Individual Values)</dt>
        <dd>
          Hidden stats from 0-15 for Attack, Defense, and Stamina. Every Pokemon
          has IVs that slightly affect its power. Written as "15/14/13" or "98%"
          (percentage of max possible).
        </dd>

        <dt id="cp">CP (Combat Power)</dt>
        <dd>
          The number shown on your Pokemon. Combines level and IVs into one number.
          Higher CP = generally stronger, but it's not the whole story.
        </dd>

        <dt id="level">Level</dt>
        <dd>
          How powered-up a Pokemon is (1-50, or 51 with best buddy boost).
          You increase level by spending Stardust and Candy. Half-levels exist
          (e.g., 25.5).
        </dd>

        <dt id="stardust">Stardust</dt>
        <dd>
          Currency used to power up and unlock second charge moves. Hard to get,
          easy to waste. Spend wisely!
        </dd>

        <dt id="candy">Candy</dt>
        <dd>
          Species-specific currency for powering up and evolving. Get it by
          catching, transferring, walking as buddy, or rare candy conversion.
        </dd>

        <dt id="xl-candy">XL Candy</dt>
        <dd>
          Special candy needed to power Pokemon past level 40 (up to 50).
          Much harder to get. Required for many top PvP picks.
        </dd>

        <dt id="shadow">Shadow Pokemon</dt>
        <dd>
          Pokemon rescued from Team Rocket. Deal and take 20% more damage.
          Darker appearance, purple flames. Often better than regular versions
          for raids.
        </dd>

        <dt id="purified">Purified Pokemon</dt>
        <dd>
          Shadow Pokemon that were purified. Get +2 to all IVs, cheaper power-up
          costs, and learn "Return." Usually worse than keeping them Shadow.
        </dd>

        <dt id="lucky">Lucky Pokemon</dt>
        <dd>
          From lucky trades. Guaranteed minimum 12/12/12 IVs and cost 50% less
          Stardust to power up. Great for expensive investments.
        </dd>

        <dt id="shiny">Shiny Pokemon</dt>
        <dd>
          Rare color variants. Purely cosmetic - same stats as regular.
          Indicated by sparkles and different coloring.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="pvp">

        <dt id="pvp-def">PvP (Player vs Player)</dt>
        <dd>
          Battling other trainers. Includes GO Battle League (ranked online)
          and friendly battles.
        </dd>

        <dt id="gbl">GBL (GO Battle League)</dt>
        <dd>
          The ranked online PvP system. Win battles to climb ranks and earn rewards.
        </dd>

        <dt id="great-league">Great League (GL)</dt>
        <dd>
          PvP format with max 1500 CP. Most accessible league - doesn't require
          huge investment. Very popular.
        </dd>

        <dt id="ultra-league">Ultra League (UL)</dt>
        <dd>
          PvP format with max 2500 CP. Requires more investment than GL.
          Some Pokemon need XL candy to compete.
        </dd>

        <dt id="master-league">Master League (ML)</dt>
        <dd>
          PvP format with no CP limit. Very expensive - need max level legendaries
          to be competitive. Best IVs are 15/15/15.
        </dd>

        <dt id="stat-product">Stat Product</dt>
        <dd>
          Attack x Defense x Stamina. A way to compare Pokemon within a CP limit.
          Higher = more total stats. This is why "bad" IVs (low attack) are often
          better in capped leagues.
        </dd>

        <dt id="rank">Rank (IV Rank)</dt>
        <dd>
          Where your Pokemon's IVs fall among all 4096 possible combinations.

        </dd>

        <dt id="bulk">Bulk</dt>
        <dd>
          Defense x Stamina. How much damage a Pokemon can take. Bulky Pokemon

        </dd>

        <dt id="meta">Meta</dt>
        <dd>
          Short for "metagame" - the most effective strategies and Pokemon at
          any given time. "Meta picks" are the commonly-used strong options.
        </dd>

        <dt id="spice">Spice Pick</dt>
        <dd>
          An unconventional Pokemon choice. Can catch opponents off-guard but
          may be less consistent than meta picks.
        </dd>

        <dt id="lead">Lead</dt>
        <dd>
          The Pokemon you start battles with. Usually something safe that can
          handle many situations.
        </dd>

        <dt id="safe-swap">Safe Swap</dt>
        <dd>
          A Pokemon you switch to when your lead is losing. Should have few
          hard counters.
        </dd>

        <dt id="closer">Closer</dt>
        <dd>
          Your last Pokemon, saved for the endgame. Often something that hits
          hard or has shield pressure.
        </dd>

        <dt id="bait">Bait</dt>
        <dd>
          Using a cheap charge move to try to get your opponent to waste a shield,
          then hitting them with your expensive nuke move.
        </dd>

        <dt id="farm-down">Farm Down</dt>
        <dd>
          When your Pokemon has already won a matchup, using only fast moves
          to build up energy before the opponent faints, so you start the next
          matchup with energy advantage.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="raids">
      <h2>Raid Terms</h2>

      <dl class="glossary">
        <dt id="raid">Raid</dt>
        <dd>
          Cooperative battles against powerful boss Pokemon at gyms. Win to
          catch the boss. Harder raids need more players.
        </dd>

        <dt id="dps">DPS (Damage Per Second)</dt>
        <dd>
          How fast a Pokemon deals damage. Higher DPS = faster raid wins =
          more rewards.
        </dd>

        <dt id="tdo">TDO (Total Damage Output)</dt>
        <dd>
          Total damage before fainting. Balances DPS with survivability.
          Sometimes you want consistency over pure speed.
        </dd>

        <dt id="counter">Counter</dt>
        <dd>
          A Pokemon that's super effective against a raid boss. Using the
          right counters makes raids much easier.
        </dd>

        <dt id="glass-cannon">Glass Cannon</dt>
        <dd>
          High damage but fragile - faints quickly. Great when you have enough
          players, risky when you don't.
        </dd>

        <dt id="anchor">Anchor</dt>
        <dd>
          A bulky Pokemon used at the end of your raid team to survive until
          the raid ends. Useful for solo/duo attempts.
        </dd>

        <dt id="short-man">Short-Man</dt>
        <dd>
          Completing a raid with fewer players than recommended. "Duo" = 2 players,

        <dt id="legacy-move">Legacy Move</dt>
        <dd>
          A move a Pokemon can no longer learn normally. Often from old Community

        <dd>
          Special move available only during Community Day events (or shortly

        <dd>
          20% damage bonus when a move matches the Pokemon's type.
