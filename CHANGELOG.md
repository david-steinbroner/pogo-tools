---

## [3.3.56] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- **Window content**: Reduced bottom padding to reveal carousel buttons fully

---

## [3.3.55] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- **Popup height**: Reduced vertical padding (14px/18px → 10px/12px)

---

## [3.3.54] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- **Opponent header**: Reduced vertical padding further (22px → 18px)

---

## [3.3.53] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- **Opponent header**: Reduced vertical padding by 6px (28px → 22px)

---

## [3.3.52] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Popup Pokemon name size**: Ensure bold names inherit correct font-size

---

## [3.3.51] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- **Popup styling**: Pokemon names now bold, reduced top padding by 4px

---

## [3.3.50] - 2026-01-22

---

## [3.3.49] - 2026-01-22

### Changed
- **Copy: clearer Best/Worst Counter popup explanations**: Second sentence now explains damage relationships in plain English

---

## [3.3.48] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Popups now accurately describe each section**: Each popup type now uses section-specific copy that matches what it represents:
  - Best/Worst Counters: Describes Pokémon counter recommendations with matchup context
  - Best/Worst Counter Types: Describes defensive Pokémon type matchups (resist vs weak to opponent)
  - Super/Not Very Effective Move Types: Describes offensive move effectiveness
- **Worst Counter Types no longer says the opposite**: Previously all type popups used generic "will perform well" copy; now worst sections correctly warn about disadvantages

---

## [3.3.47] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **"Not Very Effective Move Types" was empty/incorrect**: Fixed logic bug in `getAvoidMovesPerOpp` that referenced non-existent `chart.weak` property instead of `chart.resist`. The function now correctly identifies move types that deal reduced damage to the opponent.

  - Dark mode: near-white (`#f0f0f4`)
- **Muted type colors**: All 18 type colors reduced ~15-20% saturation for pastel look
- **Dark mode edge treatment**: Icon tiles have subtle dark stroke for glyph contrast

---

## [3.3.45] - 2026-01-22

### Changed

  - Lines align to bottom of grid cell, left-aligned with 4px margin

  - New `--icon-tile-glint` token (`inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.28)`)
  - Type result icons (Best Counter Types, Super Effective Move Types) now have subtle top highlight
  - Pressed state removes glint + flattens shadow for physical press feel

---

### Changed
- **Dark mode: appbar icon buttons - added outer outline for button silhouette**
  - New `--appbar-btn-outline` token (`rgba(255,255,255,0.22)`)
  - Box-shadow now includes `0 0 0 1px` outline stroke + drop shadow
  - Outline persists in pressed state for consistent boundary definition

---

## [3.3.40] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

---

- **Footer softened**: Smaller text (10px), muted color, `margin-top` breathing room above footer

---

## [3.3.31] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

---

## [3.3.30] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- **Internal section dividers**: Softened from `--border-default` to `--border-subtle` - lower contrast, less visual dominance

---

## [3.3.29] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- **Best Counters grid spacing**: Increased row gap from `--space-md` (16px) to `--space-lg` (24px) - reduces spreadsheet density

---

## [3.3.28] - 2026-01-21

### Summary
Reduce mobile "squish" via section rhythm + inner gutter. Tokenized hardcoded padding values.

### Changed
- **Section header rhythm**: `.carousel-header` padding reduced from `6px 2px` to `var(--space-xs)` (4px) - headers feel like labels, not dividers
- **Content spacing**: `.carousel-content` padding changed from `16px 8px` to `var(--space-md)` (16px all sides) - more breathing room after headers
- **Inner gutter**: `.window-content` padding increased from `12px` to `var(--space-md)` (16px) - content no longer pressed against frame

### Technical
- Replaced 3 hardcoded padding values with token references
- No visual redesign - same borders, bevels, typography

### Review
Open Versus tab with 2+ types selected to see the spacing improvements.

---

## [3.3.27] - 2026-01-21

### Changed
- **Button shadows**: Enhanced from `0 2px 0` to `2px 3px 0` (adds right-side shadow)
